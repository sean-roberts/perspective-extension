## Welcome to the Perspective API Extension Codebase

This extension is designed to bring Perspective feedback inline with the comments/text that you author.

### Getting Started

 1. Download extension
 2. Start writing
 3. Get Perspective feedback :+1:

When you enable the extension (chrome only atm), you will see the Perspective indicator on the bottom right of your text box when you write content.

### Pipeline (not necessarily in order)

- [x] Enable Perspective feedback on input fields.
- [ ] Show Perspective feedback text explanations.
- [ ] Allow users the ability to give submit their own feedback for a given toxicity score.
- [ ] Toggle to enable/disable the extension on a site.
- [ ] Optimize positioning for popular sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
- [ ] Firefox add-on



### Disagree with a feedback result?

As the Perspective team puts it:
>"Itâ€™s still early days and we will get a lot of things wrong."

So, for now you can not submit feedback from the extension. This is in the pipeline, though!
